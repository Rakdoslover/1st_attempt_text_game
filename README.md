# Welcome to The Lost Island!

The Lost Island is a text-based adventure game involving you the player as "The Stranger".

You wake up on a sunny beach somewhere in time and space, you have no memory and no idea of where you are.
Can you somehow figure out a way to get off the island? We'll see about that!


## Game Features

The main functions of the game is letting the player make decisions(up towards 5 choices) at each scene, that guides them off the island.
The decisions varies from simple prompts to writing or spelling names.
Depending on the players choices he/she gets a new scene defined byt their answer.

The game features multiple endings, both good and bad and can even be "cleared" at the very first stage.

Implemented a basic item pickups system where as if the player made a certain choice beforehand, they get a specific scenerio where there usually isn't one. This happens at least 3 times in story.

## Future Features

### Scrolling Text
I did experiment with scrolling text in the beginning of the project, it is something i'm still interested in and would like to implement.
Found a good link to a youtuber with easy instructions but didn't have time to implement it before deadline.

### Bigger Item System

From the very start I found the idea of making the endings different depending on the items you picked up/ used during the adventure.
It's a bigger assignement and I will continue to implement this idea further.

## Testing
The project has been test manually by doing the following things:
- 
- 
- 

### Bugs


## Deployment

The project was deployed using Code Institutes's mock terminal for Heroku.

Steps for deployment:
    1. Made the repository link for GitHub.
    2. Created a new app on Heroku.
    3. Set the buildbacks to Python and NodeJS, in that order.
    4. Link the Heroku app to the repository.
    5. Clicked on the "Deploy".



## Credits
- Code Institute for for the deployment terminal.
- AskPython for the idea of the main functions in the game.
- All the help of my mentor for guiding me through the process.
