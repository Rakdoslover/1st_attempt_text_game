# Welcome to The Lost Island!

The Lost Island is a text-based adventure game involving you the player as "The Stranger".

You wake up on a sunny beach somewhere in time and space, you have no memory and no idea of where you are.
Can you somehow figure out a way to get off the island? We'll see about that!


## Game Features

The main functions of the game is letting the player make decisions(up towards 5 choices) at each scene, that guides them off the island.
The decisions varies from simple prompts to writing or spelling names.
Depending on the players choices he/she gets a new scene defined byt their answer.

The game features multiple endings, both good and bad and can even be "cleared" at the very first stage.

Implemented a basic item pickups system where as if the player made a certain choice beforehand, they get a specific scenerio where there usually isn't one. This happens at least 3 times in story.

## Testing
The project has been test manually by doing the following things:
-

## Deployment

The project was deployed using Code Institutes's mock terminal for Heroku.

Steps for deployment:
    1. Made the repository link for GitHub.
    2. Created a new app on Heroku.
    3. Set the buildbacks to Python and NodeJS, in that order.
    4. Link the Heroku app to the repository.
    5. Clicked on the "Deploy".
